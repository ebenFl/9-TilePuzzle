Comment and clean current code

Pause game on completion and allow to be reset - Completed

Update grid so that the inital state of the game is randomly generated
and checked to ensure that it is solvable - Completed

Begin formulating a star approach to having the computer solve the puzzle
  current ideas - have algorithm run with no visual effects
                - then play out solution after algorithm is complete

Double check that the possible states are right

Begin working on A star

Add project to github - Local repo added but no global
